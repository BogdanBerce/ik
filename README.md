# Math3d

This is a minimal Go library for manipulating 3d objects in nested coordinate
spaces. It's just a playground while I'm learning about 3d math. I'm aware that
there are already excellent libraries for this task, and I'll probably use those
in future.

In case it weren't obvious, **you should not use this under circumstances**.
