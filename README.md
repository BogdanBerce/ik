# Inverse Kinematics in Go

This is an extremely inefficient [IK] [ik] library written in Go. Given a limb
specification and a goal position, this can determine an approximate solution.
I'm learning about 3d math as I go, so it's probably all wrong, but it seems to
work pretty well so far.

You should almost certainly not use this for any purpose.
